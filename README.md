# Predicting-Network-Intrusion-with-Naive-Bayes-Classifier

## The objective of this task is to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between "bad" connections, called intrusions or attacks, and "good" normal connections.

Naive Bayes Classifier was used as the predictive model for this objective
